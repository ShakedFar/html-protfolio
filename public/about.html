<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Shaked Perkash. I am 27 years old, married to Paz, and expecting our first son soon. I currently live in Rishon LeZion, Israel, but I grew up and was raised in the city of Safed. I am a third-year computer science student and currently work as an IT professional at Evedge. My hobbies include soccer, basketball, and fitness in general. My favorite soccer team is Maccabi Haifa, and I have been following them since I was a child. I mainly attend home games, but I also go to away games sometimes. I hope that this will be a favorite activity for my son and me.</p>
